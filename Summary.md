# 13_Neural_Networks

The neural network consistently exhibited an accuracy rate in the range of 0.71 to 0.75 across various experimental conditions. These conditions included variations in the number of training epochs within the range of 50 to 250, the removal of certain columns from the input data, and the implementation of a linear activation function. Despite these changes, the accuracy of the neural network remained stable within the specified range, suggesting relative insensitivity to the specified modifications.
